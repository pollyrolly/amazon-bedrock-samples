Understanding the information in this table can be important for several reasons:\n",

      "4. **Troubleshooting**: Several columns in the `STV_BLOCKLIST` table, such as `modified`, `hdr_modified`, and `unsorted`, can provide clues about the state of the data blocks, which can be helpful when troubleshooting issues related to data corruption or query performance problems.\n",

      "By analyzing the information in the `STV_BLOCKLIST` table, database administrators and developers can gain a deeper understanding of how data is stored and accessed within their Redshift cluster. This knowledge can help them optimize query performance, manage storage more effectively, and troubleshoot issues more efficiently.\n"
